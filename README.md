**Description: **
Our program recommends recipes based on what a user has in their kitchen. The user interacts with an interface that allows them to select items that are currently in their kitchen. After noting the food items in their kitchen, the user can then search for recipes (and filter them based on dietary restrictions and cuisine preferences) using the search button. 

The front end incorporates CMU graphics and object-oriented programming to create the user interface, while the back end utilizes the Spoonacular API to search for recipes using ingredients we selected from the front end.

**Modules:**
The user will need to import json, import requests, and use the CMU graphics package

**Files:**
To run the program, run the file ** RecipEat.py**
